# Go-Lang Download, Build, and Install Script
Many information security tools are built using Go-Lang. For this reason, I have scripted a simple way to quickly setup a Go-Lang environment in Linux.

Simply run the [go-setup.sh]() script. This will,
1. Download the amd64 bit versio of Go-Lang directly from Google
2. Unpack it into /usr/local
3. Set up the environment
4. Download build and install [chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel) as a test package.
